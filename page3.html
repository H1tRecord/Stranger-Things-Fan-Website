      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Nothing is known about the origins of this specific Demogorgon or its home, but it was discovered by an
        enhanced child named "Eleven," whose abilities were originally utilized by Dr. Brenner for espionage. During her
        encounter with the Demogorgon, Eleven touches it, and the creature to use her contact with it to build a "Gate"
        to the reality she knew, and thus releasing it into her world, where it hunts animals and people.</p>
      <p>It is a monstrous creature that hails from a parallel dimension reminiscent to a dark reflection of the world
        known as the Upside Down. It has the ability to create doors to other dimensions, and feed on inhabitants from
        there. After a gate was opened in Hawkins Lab, the Demogorgon begins crossing the two dimensions and feeding on
        people, until it was ultimately killed by Eleven.</p>

      <h2>Vines</h2>
      <div class="red-line"></div>
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Vines, also referred to as tendrils, are one of the dominant forms of life present in the Upside Down, and make
        up part of the Mind Flayer's hive mind; the vines are a form of life existing somewhere between the traditional
        idea of 'plant' and 'animal'. Vines would often emerge from within interdimensional gates, sprawling across the
        surrounding surface.</p>
      <p>The vines were animated by the Upside Down's hive mind. They grew like plants but behaved and moved like
        snakes, and could bind, amass and tangle up many things, including humans. Furthermore, the tendrils were
        vulnerable to brute force and fire.</p>

      <p>Adoscelent Demogorgons who haven't reached adulthood are known as Demodogs, a term coined by Dustin Henderson
        due to them basically being Demogorgons whose behavior resemble that of dogs. </p>

      <h2>Mind Flayer</h2>
      <div class="red-line"></div>
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>A mysterious entity, made up entirely of silver-black particles, originated from an unknown alternate
        dimension. This entity had many names, including the Shadow Monster, the particles, and the Mind Flayer.</p>
      <p>The entity was gigantic, looming at least fifty stories tall[1], and sported a distinctive spider-like
        appearance. The Mind Flayer exercised supreme control of the Upside Down via a psychic link, with Demogorgons,
        vines, and Demobats forming a shared hive mind; for a period in 1985, possessed humans known as "the Flayed"
        also comprised part of the hive mind. In a sense, the entirety of the Upside Down was like one gigantic
        organism, with all its contents and agents mentally connected via the Mind Flayer.</p>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>A fearsome entity aligned with the Upside Down, Vecna had humble origins as the human Henry Creel. After moving
        to a new home in Hawkins in 1959, the young Henry discovered he had remarkable psychokinetic abilities and could
        manipulate the perceptions of others. Motivated by a misanthropic and nihilistic philosophy, Henry used his
        powers to psychologically torture his family, eventually killing his mother and sister. After Henryâ€™s father,
        Victor, was falsely presumed to be the killer, Victor was imprisoned and driven further into madness.</p>
